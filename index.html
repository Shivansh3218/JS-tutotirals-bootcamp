        Javascript is a single threaded synchronous language. It means it can execute only one task at a time.

        Varibales: the containers for storing a value.

        keywords to declare and initialize a variable: let, const and var

        var: The oldest way to declare a variable. It is not recommended to use var to declare a variable.

        let: By using let it gives the facility to reassgin a value to a variable.
        
        const:  It means the varibale declared using const cannot be reassigned and redeclared, And it should remain constant throughout the program.
